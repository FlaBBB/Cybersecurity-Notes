# Cybersecurity Notes
My Markdown notes for all things cybersecurity

## Installing Obsidian on Kali

## Using Obsidian

It is easy to share individual notes from within the vault, as they are just markdown files - this lets you disseminate stuff as required, and move notes into public repositories etc.

For example, you can have a public vault of notes, linked to a public repository, where you can move writeups to as the boxes retire. This helps keep your public notes sanitised.

It also lets you push/pull down between virtual machines. OneDrive will back the notes up to the Cloud, but they will also be on Git.

Git history can show people how a collection of notes develops over time - pretty interesting, especially when putting together a cheatsheet!

Copy across cheatsheet notes to a public repo when you make changes, perhaps with a script - the only disadvantage of this is you will lose backlinks if you are not also copying across writeups, but if you bring writeups over to the public repo when the boxes retire this will work.
