# Vulnerabilities Index

This folder contains a number of CVE writeups. They are written to be quick references for CVEs I've found useful in challenges etc.

I'm not collecting every CVE in existence - that's what [ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com) is for. This is just to collect ones I have found useful, and provide PoC examples for quick reference (especially for ones where PoCs were hard to come by)
