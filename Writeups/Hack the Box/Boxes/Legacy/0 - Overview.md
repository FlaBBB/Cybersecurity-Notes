# Overview

This is the second box in my OSCP prep series.

**Box Details**

|IP|User-Rated Difficulty
|---|---|
|10.10.10.4|2.5|

---

This box was also super simple. The only difference between it and blue was the operating system and SMB username. I had rooted it within 40 minutes, and a good chunk of that time was spent documenting the process.

## Ratings

I rated both user and root a 1 for difficulty. The exploit was incredibly simple, and there was no privesc involved.
